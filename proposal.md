Roadmap proposal
================

2018
-----
- Current challenges defined in terms of GPSR commands
    + each command may be stated differently than exactly written in rulebook
    + All navigation actions can encounter obstacles, in all challenges
    + No commands yet for multiple objects (e.g. no 'put all objects...')
- Storing groceries": Grab groceries from a pile of objects
- Questions in GPSR: answer questions about current environment, robot can looks around for a little while and then answer questions like 'where are my keys'? 

2019
----
- Commands for multiple objects
    + Eg. "Put all items from the table in the closet"

2020
----
- No nore challenges: a robot is called in and given a command (anything). When it's done, the next robot in the queue is up. 
    + Still with current continue rule
