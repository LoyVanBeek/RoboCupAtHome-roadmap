Roadmap proposal
================

2018:
- Current challenges defined in terms of GPSR commands
    + each command may be stated differently that exactly written in rulebook
    + All navigation actions can encounter obstacles
    + No commands yet for multiple objects (e.g. no 'put all objects...')
- Grab groceries from a pile of objects

2019:
- Commands for multiple objects
    + Eg. "Put all items from the table in the closet"
